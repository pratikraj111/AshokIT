pause movie then bring milk then continue movie.....

----------------------------------------------------
total 100 people was their



At 3 pm manager called and told that task-102 is high priority now... first complete task-102 and continue with 101...

Note: In this scenario i can't push 101 task changes because those changes are not completed... i cant delete those changes because i spent 5 hours to write that code.

-> In this scenario we can go for 'git stash' command.

-> 'git stash' is used to save working tree changes to temp area and makes working tree clean.

-> Once task 102 changes pushed then we can get our task-101 changes back to working tree using 'git stash apply'.
